I"W<p>How is the interaction of light and atoms described in classical physics? First we start defining light and matter in terms of classical physics.</p>

<p>In classical electrodynamics, light is a wave. It is a wave of alternating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the direction of propagation and to each other. The electric and magnetic fields of light must be solutions to the electromagnetic wave equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 \vec{E} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}
\end{equation}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
  \nabla^2 \vec{B} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \vec{B}}{\partial t^2}
\end{equation}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">c</script> is the propagation speed. Every solution to the wave equation can be thought as a linear combination of many simple sinus waves with the same propagation speed <script type="math/tex">c</script>. So the must simple description of light is a sinus magnetic and a sinus electric field, for example:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
  \vec{E}(\vec{r}, t) = \vec{E}_0 \cos{(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r} - \omega t)}
\end{equation}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
  \vec{B}(\vec{r}, t) = \vec{B}_0 \cos{(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r} - \omega t)}
\end{equation}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\vec{k}</script> is the wave vector. It points to the direction of propagation and <script type="math/tex">\\|\overrightarrow{k}\\| = \dfrac{2\pi }{\lambda }</script>. And there is actually a simple and nice relationship between the electric and magnetic field:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{equation}
  \overrightarrow {B}=\dfrac {1}{\omega}\left( \overrightarrow {k}\times \overrightarrow {E}\right) 
\end{equation}</script>

<p>How can we describe an atom classically? Simple, as a positive and a negative charge connected by a spring!</p>

<p>So classically, the interaction of light and matter becomes the interaction of a spring bounded dipole with an alternating electric field!</p>
