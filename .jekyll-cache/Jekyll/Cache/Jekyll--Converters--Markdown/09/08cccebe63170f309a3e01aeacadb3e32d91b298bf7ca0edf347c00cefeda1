I"9<p>Consider a simple quantum mechanical system consisting of two eigenstates <script type="math/tex">\ket{0}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\ket{1}</script>. A coupling between these two states means that there is a non-zero probability of a particle to go from one state to the other. Physically a coupling between two states is always achieved only by external influences. For example, light can couple different states in an atom. An electron can absorb a photon and go to a higher energy state, thus we can say these two states are coupled by the photon.</p>
