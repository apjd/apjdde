I"A<p>Consider the simplest capacitor as shown in the figure. Between the two plates a dielectric material (non-conductor) is placed. As the electric field of the capacitor passes through the material, it induces electric dipole moments. The sum of the induced dipole moments per volume is called <em>Polarization</em>:</p>
