I"Æ<p>Consider the simplest capacitor as shown in the figure. Between the two plates a dielectric material (non-conductor) is placed. As the electric field of the capacitor passes through the material, it induces electric dipole moments. The sum of the induced dipole moments per volume is called <em>Polarization</em>:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">P = \frac{\sum{ex(t)}}{V}</script>,</p>

<p>with <script type="math/tex">x(t)</script> being the distance between the positive core of the atom and the electron with charge <script type="math/tex">e</script> and volume <script type="math/tex">V</script>.</p>

<p>Now these small dipole moments are microscopic capacitors by themselves and induce an electrical field that has the opposite direction compared to the external electric field. This leads to a decreased electric field inside of the material.</p>

<p>The strength of the field inside the material is described by the <em>electric Displacement</em> <script type="math/tex">D</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">D = \epsilon_0 E + P</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">D</script> has the unit of charge per area.</p>

<p>Now the polasization by itself depends on the external field:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P = \epsilon_0 \chi E</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\chi</script> is material-dependent and describes how ‚Äúeasily‚Äù can dipole moments be induced in the material. With this equation we get for the electric displacement:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">D = E(\epsilon_0 + \epsilon_0 \chi)</script>

<p>We define the relative permeability as <script type="math/tex">\epsilon = 1 + \chi</script> and finally get for the displacement field:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">D = \epsilon_0 \epsilon E</script>

<p>This equation describes the strength of the electric field inside a material.</p>
